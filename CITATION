description: This repository contains the source code for several Matlab programs that can be used to generate artificial trajectories:
1) ArtificialTrajectories2: this routine was developed to produce artificial trajectories by Sbalzarini and co-workers (Helmuth et al., 2007).
2) NoisyTrajectoryGeneration: this routine was developed by the OMEGA team to produce "noisy" artificial trajectories as described (Rigano et al., 2018a and 2018b).
3) Brownian1: this routine was developed to produce Brownian trajectories by the OMEGA team as described (Rigano et al., 2018a and 2018b).
4) Brownian2: this routine was developed to produce Brownian trajectories by the OMEGA team as described (Rigano et al., 2018a and 2018b).
