# Trajectory Generator
This repository contains the source code for several Matlab programs that can be used to generate artificial trajectories.

1. ArtificialTrajectories2 Matlab routine developed earlier for this purpose.
2. NoisyTrajectories and used as a basis for “noisy” trajectory generation.
3. BrownianTrajectories1
4. BrownianTrajectories2
