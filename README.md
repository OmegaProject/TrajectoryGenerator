# Trajectory Generator
This repository contains the source code for several Matlab programs that can be used to generate artificial trajectories of known mobility characteristics (i.e. observed Diffusion constant and Moment Scaling Spectrum; Ewers et al., 2005):

1. *ArtificialTrajectories2*: this routine was developed to produce artificial trajectories by Sbalzarini and co-workers (Helmuth et al., 2007).
2. *NoisyTrajectoryGeneration*: this routine was developed by the OMEGA team to produce "noisy" artificial trajectories as described (Rigano et al., 2018a and 2018b).
3. *Brownian1*: this routine was developed to produce Brownian trajectories by the OMEGA team as described (Rigano et al., 2018a and 2018b).
4. *Brownian2*: this routine was developed to produce Brownian trajectories by the OMEGA team as described (Rigano et al., 2018a and 2018b).
